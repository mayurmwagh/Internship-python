# #Sequential Data Type 
# # List , Tuple, Directory, Sets, 
# # List
# # Definition: A list is an ordered, mutable (changeable) collection.

# # Syntax: my_list = [1, 2, 3, 'apple']

# # Key Features:

# # Supports different data types

# # Allows indexing and slicing

# # Supports methods like append(), remove(), sort(), etc.



# # 2. Tuple
# # Definition: A tuple is an ordered, immutable (unchangeable) collection.

# # Syntax: my_tuple = (1, 2, 3)

# # Key Features:

# # Faster than lists

# # Useful for fixed data

# # Supports indexing and slicing


# #  3. String
# # Definition: A string is a sequence of characters.

# # Syntax: my_string = "Hello"

# # Key Features:

# # Immutable

# # Supports slicing and string methods like upper(), lower(), split(), etc.


# a = [8,3,2,3,2]
# print(a)

# a[2] = "Mayur"
# print (a)

# a.remove("Mayur")
# print(a)

# a.sort()
# print(a)


# # Combine 2 list

# a = [1,2,6,3,7,2,3]
# b = [9,3,42,8,2]

# c = (a + b) 
# d = [(a), (b)]

# print(c)
# print(d)

# v = sum(a)
# print(v)

# #Tuple
# #Tuple can define in ()
# a = (2,34,1,4,7)

# print(a)

# #Dictionary: is used to store data in key value format
# b= {"a": "sahin", "b":"sehawag", "c":"Dravid"}

# print(b)

# x= b["a"]
# print(x)

# #To add in Dictionary 
# b["d"] = "Zaheer"
# print(b)

# #To delete in Dictionary 
# del b["b"]
# print(b)

#Arithmatic Oprators
# x = 10
# y = 2
# print (x+y)
# print (x-y)

# print (x/y)
# print (x//y)
